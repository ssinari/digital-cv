#  Biostatistician

<i class="fa fa-user fa-1x"> **PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**</i>

Experienced biostatistician with strong applied statistics and computing
background. Hands on experience in writing statistical analysis plans (SAP),
designing experiments and providing insightful, actionable reports. Effective at
communicating complex results to diverse audiences, and ensuring understanding
of requirements at all levels of a cross functional team for smooth
collaboration and timely execution of projects.

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-1x"> CAREER HIGHLIGHTS</i>

### Statistical contributions:
- Decided appropriate statistical strategies on several grants and
projects.
- Analyzed data with missing or repeated measures, time to event
response or relative abundance measures such as RNA-Seq and
microbiome datasets.
- Ensured data provenance with good data hygiene.
- Used Bayesian, empirical Bayes, and frequentist techniques as
appropriate.
- Managed client expectations with timely delivery of complex
analyses, meeting pre and post funding deliverables, resulting in
highly cited publications.
- Successfully completed support as primary statistician on multi-
center, multi-year complex grants and projects (Program Projects
and R01).


### Computational contributions:
- Operationalized statistical strategies with efficient computing.
- Performed quality control, data cleaning and data engineering.
- Designed, developed, and implemented appropriate computing
infrastructure required for study monitoring and analyses.
- Developed reusable and modular software components such as R
packages, analytic workflows, and data visualizations such as shiny
apps and dashboards.
- Implemented best computing practices using knitr, R Notebooks,
version control like Git and containers like Docker.

### Team contributions:
Exchanged ideas with colleagues to learn and implement emerging
analytical and computational techniques. Mentored other team
members and student collaborators as required.
